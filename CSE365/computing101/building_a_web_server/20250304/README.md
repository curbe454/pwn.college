This is the record of my solution in "Builiding a Web Server" in Computing 101 module in CSE365-2025spring.

There're still two challenges I haven't done. Exactly, I don't know what I'm doing in these series of challenge.

I mean I am stuck at the rest of two challenges.

It's a pity that there's only two challenges in this module. I'll go back someday.
